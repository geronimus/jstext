## firstOccurrence( substrings, text )

Returns the index of the first occurrence of one of the substrings within the text.

The returned index is that of the logical character, and not of the byte. So be careful with strings containing multi-byte characters.

### Parameters

`substrings` _string | Array[ string ]_

You can pass a single string, or an array of strings. These are the values that we are looking for in the text.

`text` _string_

The text to search for an occurrence of one of the substrings.

### Return value

If the substring is not found within the text - or if the text or all of the substrings are the empty string - then the return value is: `-1`;

Otherwise, the return value is the index of the character within the text.

However, note that if the text contains any multi-byte characters, the returned value is the index of the logical character, and not of the byte - which is what you would get from `String.prototype.indexOf()`.

## head( text )

A function to help you safely iterate over a text value as a sequence of characters.

It returns the first character in the text value, irrespective of how many bytes it contains.

### Parameters

`text` _string_

The text whose first character you wish to return.

### Return value

If the text contains at least one character, it returns the first character.

Otherwise, it returns the empty string value.

### Examples

```javascript
head( "head" ); // => "h"
head( "ðŸš• ðŸ›µ" ); // => "ðŸš•"
head( "" ); // => ""
```
---

## tail( text )

A function to help you safely iterate over a text value as a sequence of characters.

It returns the string of all characters following the first, irrespective of how many bytes the the characters contain.

### Parameters

`text` _string_

The text for which you wish to return all characters except the first.

### Return value

_string_

If the text contains at least two characters, it returns the string of all characters except the first.

Otherwise, it returns the empty string value.

### Examples

```javascript
tail( "tail" ); // => "ail"
tail( "ðŸš• ðŸ›µ" ); // => " ðŸ›µ"
tail( "a" ); // => ""
```
